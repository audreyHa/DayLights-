# DayLights-
Simple positivity app! Users log one thing you did well, one thing you're grateful for, and one joyful moment from today.

## Motivation


## Features


## Privacy Policy
DayLights incorporates a light-weight analytical tool called <b>Answers</b> (refer to [this document](https://answers.io/img/onepager/privacy.pdf) for detailed privacy policy). This service is used to track how many times all users land on different screens. Data regarding your personal information (including name, gender, contact information, location) will not be collected. Your identity will not be linked to any of the observed behaviors.

The only purpose of collecting user behavior data for this version is to improve user experience and guide development for the next release. If you do not wish to participate and help the app (and me) better understand your needs, you are always welcome to come back and install a later version.

All data regarding your recordings and recording information is stored locally on your phone. No third party (including me!) has access to your personal data or content stored in this app.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at DayLights@gmail.com!

Happy DayLighting!

Sincerely,
Audrey Ha
